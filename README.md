## Project Description
The application, developed by the Group11, allows backing up a chosen folder to a USB device without using the presumed non-functional monitor, through specific figures drawn with the mouse.
Specifically, the command is activated by drawing a rectangle that, starting from the top-left corner of the monitor, follows all four edges of the screen in full-screen mode.

## Main Features
- At the start of the application, by launching the "emergency_backup.exe" file, a configuration window will open. In this window, the folder to be backed up must be specified, along with, optionally, the file extensions of interest for the backup. This configuration will be saved, so it wonâ€™t need to be entered each time the application is launched.
- The application is designed to run in the background; therefore, once opened, it will not be possible to close the configuration GUI using the standard X button in the corner. This ensures its availability when needed.
- The application does not contain any malicious software. All configuration and backup data are protected by privacy regulations in compliance with the European GDPR standards.
- The application is portable, ensuring its functionality on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Each executable file is contained within the release folder of its respective operating system, along with the two folders required for images and audio tracks.

# üõ°Ô∏è Emergency Backup

**Emergency Backup** is an application designed to create a backup of a selected folder to a USB device‚Äîeven in emergency situations where the monitor is unavailable. The backup is triggered through a specific gesture drawn with the mouse, ensuring an intuitive and accessible interface.

## Main Features

- **Initial Setup**: When launching the application (`emergency_backup.exe`), a configuration window allows you to:
  - Select the folder to be backed up
  - Optionally specify which file extensions to include
  - Save the settings for future use

- **Runs in Background**: After setup, the application continues running in the background. The configuration window cannot be closed using the standard "X" button, ensuring the app remains active and ready.

- **Gesture-Based Activation**: The backup is triggered by drawing a rectangle with the mouse along the four edges of the screen in fullscreen mode, starting from the top-left corner. This gesture simulates an emergency command to start the backup without needing a functional display.
